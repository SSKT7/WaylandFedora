Hey there , Its my personal config . If u manage to download all the dependencies , Im sure u can copy this ricing completely.
Its my second setup with hyprland . I have seen less ricing on hyprland with fedora . So I have decided to make a one and u can see the result . It is made with black and white theme which perfectly blends with the wallpaper from dgrayman anime . 

        My Noah Family Hyprland setup

Some keybindings : 




        mod + retuen = kitty 
        mod + d = wofi
        mod + q = kill all 
        mod + print = Screenshot full



Some might say hyprland performs well with nix os or arch base distros . But i dont see any issue with fedora . I had problem switching to pulseaudio , cause fedora is partnered with pipewire . So I made my setup on pipewire haha.



Issue : 
You will find a problem with sound volume raising more than 100 and trust me it keeps raising because I didnt make any script with wpctl . I just like the way it is . Everyone knows laptops speaker aint that good . So I like this sound boost with my laptop .
